seek() and tell() functions
In Python, the seek() and tell() functions are used to work with file objects and their positions within a file.
 These functions are part of the built-in io module, which provides a consistent interface for reading and writing 
 to various file-like objects, such as files, pipes, and in-memory buffers.

seek() function
The seek() function allows you to move the current position within a file to a specific point.
 The position is specified in bytes, and you can move either forward or backward from the current position. 
 For example:
'''

with open('file.txt','r') as f:
    print(type(f))

    # Move to the 10th byte in the file

    f.seek(10)

    # read the next 5 bytes
    data = f.read(5)
