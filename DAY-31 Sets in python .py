# set in python  Sets are unordered collection of data items.
# They store multiple items in a single variable. Set items are separated by commas and enclosed within curly brackets {}. 
# Sets are unchangeable, meaning you cannot change items of the set once created. Sets do not contain duplicate items.

s = {5,9,5,8,1,2,3} # here you cannot repeat the values and sets also doesnot maintain the orders
print(s)

info = {"saga", 74, False, 8.2, 45} # 
print(info)
